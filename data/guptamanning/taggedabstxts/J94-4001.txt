A <tag name="DOMAIN" value="start"/><tag name="FOCUS" value="start"/>Syntactic Analysis<tag name="FOCUS" value="end"/><tag name="DOMAIN" value="end"/>  Method Of Long Japanese Sentences Based On The Detection Of <tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="start"/>Conjunctive Structures<tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="end"/> .
This paper presents a <tag name="DOMAIN" value="start"/><tag name="FOCUS" value="start"/>syntactic analysis<tag name="FOCUS" value="end"/><tag name="DOMAIN" value="end"/> method that first detects <tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="start"/>conjunctive structures<tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="end"/> in a sentence by checking parallelism of two series of words and then analyzes the <tag name="DOMAIN" value="start"/>dependency structure<tag name="DOMAIN" value="end"/> of the sentence with the help of the information about the <tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="start"/>conjunctive structures<tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="end"/> .
Analysis of long sentences is one of the most difficult problems in natural language processing .
The main reason for this difficulty is the structural ambiguity that is common for <tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="start"/>conjunctive structures<tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="end"/> that appear in long sentences .
Human beings can recognize <tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="start"/>conjunctive structures<tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="end"/> because of a certain , but sometimes subtle , similarity that exists between conjuncts .
Therefore , we have developed an algorithm for calculating a similarity measure between two arbitrary series of words from the left and the right of a conjunction and selecting the two most similar series of words that can reasonably be considered as composing a <tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="start"/>conjunctive structure<tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="end"/> .
This is realized using a <tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="start"/>dynamic programming <tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="end"/> technique .
A long sentence can be reduced into a shorter form by recognizing <tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="start"/>conjunctive structures<tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="end"/> .
Consequently , the total <tag name="DOMAIN" value="start"/>dependency structure<tag name="DOMAIN" value="end"/>  of a sentence can be obtained by relatively simple <tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="start"/>head-dependent rules<tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="end"/> .
A serious problem concerning <tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="start"/>conjunctive structures<tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="end"/> , besides the ambiguity of their scopes , is the ellipsis of some of their components .
Through our <tag name="DOMAIN" value="start"/>dependency analysis<tag name="DOMAIN" value="end"/> process , we can find the ellipses and recover the omitted components .
We report the results of analyzing 150Japanese sentences to illustrate the effectiveness of this method .
