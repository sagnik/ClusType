Large Scale Testing Of A <tag name="DOMAIN" value="start"/><tag name="FOCUS" value="start"/>Descriptive Phrase Finder<tag name="FOCUS" value="end"/><tag name="DOMAIN" value="end"/> .
This paper describes an evaluation of an existing technique that locates <tag name="DOMAIN" value="start"/>sentences containing descriptions of a query word or phrase<tag name="DOMAIN" value="end"/> .
The experiments expand on previous tests by exploring the effectiveness of the system when searching from a much larger document collection .
The results showed the system working significantly better than when searching over smaller collections .
The improvement was such , that a more stringent definition of what constituted a correct description was devised to better measure effectiveness .
The results also pointed to potentially new forms of evidence that might be used in improving the location process .
