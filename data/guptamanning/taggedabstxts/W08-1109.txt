There is a prevailing assumption in the literature on <tag name="FOCUS" value="start"/><tag name="DOMAIN" value="start"/>referring expression generation<tag name="DOMAIN" value="end"/><tag name="FOCUS" value="end"/> that relations are used in descriptions only ` as a last resort ' , typically on the basis that including the second entity in the relation introduces an additional cognitive load for either speaker or hearer .
In this paper , we describe an experiemt that attempts to test this assumption ; we determine that , even in simple scenes where the use of relations is not strictly required in order to identify an entity , relations are in fact often used .
We draw some conclusions as to what this means for the development of algorithms for the <tag name="DOMAIN" value="start"/><tag name="FOCUS" value="start"/>generation of referring expressions<tag name="FOCUS" value="end"/><tag name="DOMAIN" value="end"/> .
