This paper describes a method to <tag name="DOMAIN" value="start"/><tag name="FOCUS" value="start"/>parse and understand a `` noisy '' sentence<tag name="FOCUS" value="end"/><tag name="DOMAIN" value="end"/> that possibly includes errors caused by a speech recognition device .
Our parser is connected to a speech recognition device which takes a continuously spoken sentence in Japanese and produces a sequence of phonemes .
The output sequence of phonemes can quite possibly include errors : altered phonemes , extra phonemes and missing phonemes .
The task is to <tag name="DOMAIN" value="start"/><tag name="FOCUS" value="start"/>parse the noisy phoneme sequence<tag name="FOCUS" value="end"/><tag name="DOMAIN" value="end"/> and understand the meaning of the original input sentence , given an augmented context-free grammar whose terminal symbols are phonemes .
A very efficient <tag name="DOMAIN" value="start"/><tag name="FOCUS" value="start"/>parsing<tag name="FOCUS" value="end"/><tag name="DOMAIN" value="end"/> method is required , as the task 's search space is much larger than that of parsing un-noisy sentences .
We adopt the <tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="start"/>generalized LR<tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="end"/><tag name="DOMAIN" value="start"/> <tag name="FOCUS" value="start"/>parsing<tag name="FOCUS" value="end"/><tag name="DOMAIN" value="end"/> algorithm , and a certain scoring scheme to select the most likely sentence o ~ t of multiple sentence candidates .
The use of a <tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="start"/>confusion matrix<tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="end"/> , which is created in advance by analyzing a large set of input\/output pairs , is discussed to improve the scoring accuracy .
The system has been integrated into CMU 's knowledge-based <tag name="DOMAIN" value="start"/>machine translation<tag name="DOMAIN" value="end"/> system .
