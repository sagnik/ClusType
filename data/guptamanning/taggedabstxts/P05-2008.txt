<tag name="DOMAIN" value="start"/><tag name="FOCUS" value="start"/>Sentiment Classification<tag name="FOCUS" value="end"/><tag name="DOMAIN" value="end"/> seeks to identify a piece of text according to its author 's general feeling toward their subject , be it positive or negative .
Traditional machine learning techniques have been applied to this problem with reasonable success , but they have been shown to work well only when there is a good match between the training and test data with respect to topic .
This paper demonstrates that match with respect to domain and time is also important , and presents preliminary experiments with training data labeled with <tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="start"/>emoticons<tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="end"/> , which has the potential of being independent of domain , topic and time .
