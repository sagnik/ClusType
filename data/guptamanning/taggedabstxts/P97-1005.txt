Automatic <tag name="FOCUS" value="start"/><tag name="DOMAIN" value="start"/>Detection Of Text Genre<tag name="DOMAIN" value="end"/><tag name="FOCUS" value="end"/> .
As the text databases available to users become larger and more heterogeneous , genre becomes increasingly important for computational linguistics as a complement to topical and structural principles of classification .
We propose a theory of genres as bundles of facets , which correlate with various <tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="start"/>surface cues<tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="end"/> , and argue that <tag name="DOMAIN" value="start"/><tag name="FOCUS" value="start"/>genre detection<tag name="FOCUS" value="end"/><tag name="DOMAIN" value="end"/> based on <tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="start"/>surface cues<tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="end"/> is as successful as detection based on deeper structural properties .
