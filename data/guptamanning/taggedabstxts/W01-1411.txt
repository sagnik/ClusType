Towards A Simple And Accurate <tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="start"/><tag name="FOCUS" value="start"/>Statistical <tag name="FOCUS" value="end"/><tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="end"/> Approach To Learning  <tag name="DOMAIN" value="start"/><tag name="FOCUS" value="start"/>Translation Relationships Among Words<tag name="FOCUS" value="end"/><tag name="DOMAIN" value="end"/> .
We report on a project to derive <tag name="DOMAIN" value="start"/><tag name="FOCUS" value="start"/>word translation<tag name="FOCUS" value="end"/><tag name="DOMAIN" value="end"/>  relationships automatically from parallel corpora .
Our effort is distinguished by the use of simpler , faster models than those used in previous high-accuracy approaches .
Our methods achieve accuracy on <tag name="DOMAIN" value="start"/><tag name="FOCUS" value="start"/>singleword translations<tag name="FOCUS" value="end"/><tag name="DOMAIN" value="end"/> that seems comparable to any work previously reported , up to nearly 60 % coverage of word types , and they perform particularly well on a class of multi-word compounds of special interest to our translation effort .
