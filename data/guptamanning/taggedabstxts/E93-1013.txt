Semantic theories of natural language associate meanings with utterances by providing meanings for lexical items and rules for determining the meaning of larger units given the meanings of their parts .
Traditionally , meanings are combined via function composition , which works well when constituent structure trees are used to guide semantic composition .
More recently , the functional structure of <tag name="FOCUS" value="start"/><tag name="DOMAIN" value="start"/>LFG<tag name="DOMAIN" value="end"/><tag name="FOCUS" value="end"/> has been used to provide the syntactic information necessary for constraining derivations of meaning in a cross-linguistically uniform format .
It has been difficult , however , to reconcile this approach with the combination of meanings by function composition .
In contrast to compositional approaches , we present a <tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="start"/>deductive <tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="end"/> approach to <tag name="DOMAIN" value="start"/><tag name="FOCUS" value="start"/>assembling meanings<tag name="FOCUS" value="end"/><tag name="DOMAIN" value="end"/> , based on reasoning with <tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="start"/><tag name="FOCUS" value="start"/>constraints<tag name="FOCUS" value="end"/><tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="end"/> , which meshes well with the unordered nature of information in the functional structure .
Our use of <tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="start"/>linear logic<tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="end"/> as a ` glue ' for <tag name="DOMAIN" value="start"/><tag name="FOCUS" value="start"/>assembling meanings<tag name="FOCUS" value="end"/><tag name="DOMAIN" value="end"/> also allows for a coherent treatment of modification as well as of the LFG requirements of completeness and coherence .
