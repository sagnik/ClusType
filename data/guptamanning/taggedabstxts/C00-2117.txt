In this paper we present a method for detecting the text <tag name="DOMAIN" value="start"/>genre<tag name="DOMAIN" value="end"/> quickly and easily following an approach originally proposed in authorship attribution studies which uses as style markers the frequencies of occurrence of the most frequent words in a training corpus -LRB- Burrows , 1992 -RRB- .
In contrast to this approach we use the frequencies of occurrence of the most <tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="start"/>frequent words<tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="end"/> of the entire written language .
Using as testing ground a part of the Wall Street Journal corpus , we show that the most <tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="start"/>frequent words<tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="end"/> of the British National Corpus , representing the most <tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="start"/>frequent words<tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="end"/> of the written English language , are more reliable discriminators of text <tag name="DOMAIN" value="start"/><tag name="FOCUS" value="start"/>genre<tag name="FOCUS" value="end"/><tag name="DOMAIN" value="end"/> in comparison to the most frequent words of the training corpus .
Moreover , the fi'equencies of occurrence of the most common punctuation marks play an important role in terms of accurate text categorization as well as when dealing with training data of limited size .
