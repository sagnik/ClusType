Much interest already exists in the electronics research community for developing and integrating speech technology to a variety of applications , ranging from voice-activated systems to automatic telephone transactions .
This interest is particularly true in the field of aerospace where the training and operational demands on the crew have significantly increased with the proliferation of technology .
Indeed , with advances in vehicule and robot automation , the role of the human operator has evolved from that of pilot\/driver and manual controller to supervisor and decision maker .
Lately , some effort has been expended to implement alternative modes of system control , but automatic speech recognition -LRB- ASR -RRB- and human-computer interaction -LRB- HCI -RRB- research have only recently extended to civilian aviation and space applications .
The purpose of this paper is to present the particularities of <tag name="FOCUS" value="start"/><tag name="DOMAIN" value="start"/>operator-computer interaction <tag name="DOMAIN" value="end"/><tag name="FOCUS" value="end"/> in the unique conditions found in space .
The potential for <tag name="DOMAIN" value="start"/>voice control applications inside spacecraft<tag name="DOMAIN" value="end"/> is outlined and methods of integrating spoken-language interfaces onto operational space systems are suggested .
