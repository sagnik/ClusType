Fully unsupervised pattern-based methods for discovery of word categories have been proven to be useful in several languages .
The majority of these methods rely on the existence of function words as separate text units .
However , in morphology-rich languages , in particular Semitic languages such as Hebrew and Arabic , the equivalents of such function words are usually written as morphemes attached as prefixes to other words .
As a result , they are missed by word-based pattern discovery methods , causing many useful patterns to be undetected and a drastic deterioration in performance .
To enable high quality <tag name="DOMAIN" value="start"/><tag name="FOCUS" value="start"/>lexical category<tag name="FOCUS" value="end"/><tag name="DOMAIN" value="end"/> acquisition , we propose a simple <tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="start"/>unsupervised word segmentation<tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="end"/> algorithm that separates these morphemes .
We study the performance of the algorithm for Hebrew and Arabic , and show that it indeed improves a state-of-art <tag name="FOCUS" value="start"/><tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="start"/> unsupervised<tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="end"/> <tag name="DOMAIN" value="start"/>concept acquisition<tag name="DOMAIN" value="end"/><tag name="FOCUS" value="end"/> algorithm in Hebrew .
