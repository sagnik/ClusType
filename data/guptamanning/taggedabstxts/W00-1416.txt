On Identifying  <tag name="FOCUS" value="start"/><tag name="DOMAIN" value="start"/>Sets<tag name="DOMAIN" value="end"/><tag name="FOCUS" value="end"/> .
A range of research has explored the problem of generating referring expressions that uniquely identify a single entity from the shared context .
But what about expressions that identify sets of entities ?
In this paper , I adapt recent semantic research on plural descriptions -- using <tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="start"/>covers<tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="end"/> to abstract collective and distributive readings and using sets of assignments to represent <tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="start"/>dependencies<tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="end"/> among references -- to describe a search problem for <tag name="DOMAIN" value="start"/><tag name="FOCUS" value="start"/>set-identifying expressions<tag name="FOCUS" value="end"/><tag name="DOMAIN" value="end"/> that largely mirrors the search problem for singular referring expressions .
By structuring the search space only in terms of the words that can be added to the description , the proposal defuses potential combinatorial explosions that might otherwise arise with reference to sets .
