With increasing opportunities to learn online , the problem of positioning learners in an educational network of content offers new possibilities for the utilisation of geometry-based natural language processing techniques .
In this article , the adoption of <tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="start"/>latent semantic analysis<tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="end"/> -LRB- <tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="start"/>LSA<tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="end"/> -RRB- for guiding learners in their conceptual development is investigated .
We propose five new algorithmic derivations of <tag name="FOCUS" value="start"/><tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="start"/>LSA<tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="end"/><tag name="FOCUS" value="end"/> and test their validity for positioning in an experiment in order to draw back conclusions on the suitability of machine learning from previously accredited evidence .
Special attention is thereby directed towards the role of distractors and the calculation of thresholds when using similarities as a proxy for assessing conceptual closeness .
Results indicate that <tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="start"/>learning<tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="end"/> improves <tag name="DOMAIN" value="start"/>positioning<tag name="DOMAIN" value="end"/> .
Distractors are of low value and seem to be replaceable by generic noise to improve threshold calculation .
Furthermore , new ways to flexibly calculate thresholds could be identified .
