Coping With Ambiguity And Unknown Words Through <tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="start"/><tag name="FOCUS" value="start"/>Probabilistic <tag name="FOCUS" value="end"/><tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="end"/> Models .
From spring 1990 through fall 1991 , we performed a battery of small experiments to test the effectiveness of supplementing knowledge-based techniques with <tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="start"/><tag name="FOCUS" value="start"/>probabilistic<tag name="FOCUS" value="end"/><tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="end"/> models .
This paper reports our experiments in predicting <tag name="DOMAIN" value="start"/>parts of speech <tag name="DOMAIN" value="end"/> of highly ambiguous words , predicting the intended interpretation of an utterance when more than one interpretation satisfies all known syntactic and semantic constraints , and learning <tag name="DOMAIN" value="start"/>case frame information for verbs<tag name="DOMAIN" value="end"/> from example uses .
From these experiments , we are convinced that <tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="start"/><tag name="FOCUS" value="start"/>probabilistic<tag name="FOCUS" value="end"/> <tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="end"/> models based on annotated corpora can effectively reduce the ambiguity in processing text and can be used to acquire lexical information from a corpu> , by supplementing knowledge-based techniques .
Based on the results of those experiments , we have constructed a new natural language system -LRB- PLUM -RRB- for extracting data from text , e.g. , newswire text .
