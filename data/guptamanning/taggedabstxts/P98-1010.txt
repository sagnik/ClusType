Recognizing <tag name="DOMAIN" value="start"/><tag name="FOCUS" value="start"/>shallow linguistic patterns<tag name="FOCUS" value="end"/><tag name="DOMAIN" value="end"/> , such as basic syntactic relationships between words , is a common task in applied natural language and text processing .
The common practice for approaching this task is by tedious manual definition of possible pattern structures , often in the form of regular expressions or finite automata .
This paper presents a novel <tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="start"/><tag name="FOCUS" value="start"/>memory-based learning<tag name="FOCUS" value="end"/><tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="end"/> method that recognizes <tag name="DOMAIN" value="start"/> <tag name="FOCUS" value="start"/>shallow patterns<tag name="FOCUS" value="end"/><tag name="DOMAIN" value="end"/> in new text based on a <tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="start"/>bracketed training corpus<tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="end"/> .
The training data are stored as-is , in efficient suffix-tree data structures .
Generalization is performed on-line at recognition time by comparing subsequences of the new text to positive and negative evidence in the corpus .
This way , no information in the training is lost , as can happen in other learning systems that construct a single generalized model at the time of training .
The paper presents experimental results for <tag name="DOMAIN" value="start"/>recognizing noun phrase , subject-verb and verb-object patterns in English<tag name="DOMAIN" value="end"/> .
Since the learning approach enables easy porting to new domains , we plan to apply it to syntactic patterns in other languages and to sub-language patterns for <tag name="DOMAIN" value="start"/>information extraction<tag name="DOMAIN" value="end"/> .
