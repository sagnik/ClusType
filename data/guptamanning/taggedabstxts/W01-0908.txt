Statistical NLP systems are frequently evaluated and compared on the basis of their performances on a single split of training and test data .
Results obtained using a single split are , however , subject to sampling noise .
In this paper we argue in favor of reporting a <tag name="FOCUS" value="start"/><tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="start"/>distribution of performance<tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="end"/><tag name="FOCUS" value="end"/> gures , obtained by <tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="start"/>resampling<tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="end"/> the training data , rather than a single number .
The additional information from distributions can be used to make statistically quanti ed statements about di erences across parameter settings , systems , and corpora .
