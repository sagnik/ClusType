A Multi-Purpose Interface To An <tag name="FOCUS" value="start"/><tag name="DOMAIN" value="start"/>On-Line Dictionary<tag name="DOMAIN" value="end"/><tag name="FOCUS" value="end"/> .
We argue that there are two qualitatively different modes of using a <tag name="FOCUS" value="start"/><tag name="DOMAIN" value="start"/>machine-readable dictionary<tag name="DOMAIN" value="end"/><tag name="FOCUS" value="end"/> in the context of research in computational linguistics : batch processing of the source with the purpose of collating information for subsequent use by a natural language application , and placing the dictionary on-line in an environment which supports fast interactive access to data selected on the basis of a number of <tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="start"/>linguistic constraints<tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="end"/> .
While it is the former mode of dictionary use which is characteristic of most computational linguistics work to date , it is the latter which has the potential of making maximal use of the information typically found in a machine-readable dictionary .
We describe the mounting of the machine-readable source of the  <tag name="FOCUS" value="start"/>Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English<tag name="FOCUS" value="end"/> on a single user workstation to make it available as a development tool for a number of research projects .
