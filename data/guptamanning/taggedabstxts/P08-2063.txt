Choosing Sense Distinctions for <tag name="FOCUS" value="start"/><tag name="DOMAIN" value="start"/>WSD<tag name="DOMAIN" value="end"/><tag name="FOCUS" value="end"/> : <tag name="FOCUS" value="start"/>Psycholinguistic<tag name="FOCUS" value="end"/> Evidence .
Supervised <tag name="FOCUS" value="start"/><tag name="DOMAIN" value="start"/>word sense disambiguation<tag name="DOMAIN" value="end"/><tag name="FOCUS" value="end"/> requires training corpora that have been tagged with word senses , which begs the question of which word senses to tag with .
The default choice has been WordNet , with its broad coverage and easy accessibility .
However , concerns have been raised about the appropriateness of its fine-grained word senses for WSD .
<tag name="DOMAIN" value="start"/><tag name="FOCUS" value="start"/>WSD<tag name="FOCUS" value="end"/><tag name="DOMAIN" value="end"/> systems have been far more successful in distinguishing coarsegrained senses than fine-grained ones -LRB- Navigli , 2006 -RRB- , but does that approach neglect necessary meaning differences ?
Recent <tag name="FOCUS" value="start"/>psycholinguistic<tag name="FOCUS" value="end"/> evidence seems to indicate that closely related word senses may be represented in the mental lexicon much like a single sense , whereas distantly related senses may be represented more like discrete entities .
These results suggest that , for the purposes of <tag name="DOMAIN" value="start"/><tag name="FOCUS" value="start"/>WSD<tag name="FOCUS" value="end"/><tag name="DOMAIN" value="end"/> , closely related word senses can be <tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="start"/>clustered<tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="end"/> together into a more general sense with little meaning loss .
The current paper will describe this <tag name="FOCUS" value="start"/>psycholinguistic<tag name="FOCUS" value="end"/> research and its implications for automatic <tag name="DOMAIN" value="start"/> <tag name="FOCUS" value="start"/>word sense disambiguation<tag name="FOCUS" value="end"/><tag name="DOMAIN" value="end"/> .
