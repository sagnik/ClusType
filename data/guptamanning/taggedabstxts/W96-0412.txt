An Evaluation Of <tag name="FOCUS" value="start"/><tag name="DOMAIN" value="start"/>Anaphor Generation<tag name="DOMAIN" value="end"/><tag name="FOCUS" value="end"/> In Chinese .
In this paper , we present an evaluation of <tag name="FOCUS" value="start"/><tag name="DOMAIN" value="start"/>anaphors generated<tag name="DOMAIN" value="end"/><tag name="FOCUS" value="end"/> by a Chinese <tag name="DOMAIN" value="start"/>natural language generation<tag name="DOMAIN" value="end"/> system .
In the evaluation work , the anaphors in five test texts generated by three test systems employing generation <tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="start"/>rules<tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="end"/> with different complexities ~ vere compared with the ones in the same texts created by twelve native speakers of Chinese .
We took the average number of <tag name="FOCUS" value="start"/><tag name="DOMAIN" value="start"/>anaphors<tag name="DOMAIN" value="end"/><tag name="FOCUS" value="end"/> matching between the machine and human texts as a measure of the quality of anaphors generated by the test systems .
The results suggest that the one we have chosen and which has the most complex <tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="start"/>rule<tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="end"/> is better than the other two .
There axe , however , real difficulties in establishing the significance of the results because of the degree of disagreement among the native speakers .
