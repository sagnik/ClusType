Standard <tag name="DOMAIN" value="start"/><tag name="FOCUS" value="start"/>IR<tag name="FOCUS" value="end"/><tag name="DOMAIN" value="end"/> systems can process queries such as `` web NOT internet '' , enabling users who are interested in arachnids to avoid documents about computing .
The documents retrieved for such a query should be irrelevant to the negated query term .
Most systems implement this by reprocessing results after retrieval to remove documents containing the unwanted string of letters .
This paper describes and evaluates a theoretically motivated method for removing unwanted meanings directly from the original query in <tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="start"/>vector models<tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="end"/> , with the same <tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="start"/>vector negation<tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="end"/> operator as used in quantum logic .
Irrelevance in vector spaces is modelled using <tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="start"/>orthogonality<tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="end"/> , so query vectors are made orthogonal to the negated term or terms .
As well as removing unwanted terms , this form of <tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="start"/>vector negation<tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="end"/> reduces the occurrence of synonyms and neighbors of the negated terms by as much as 76 % compared with standard Boolean methods .
By altering the query vector itself , <tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="start"/>vector negation<tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="end"/> removes not only unwanted strings but unwanted meanings .
