A <tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="start"/>Dynamic Temporal Logic Of Events , Intervals And States<tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="end"/> For <tag name="FOCUS" value="start"/><tag name="DOMAIN" value="start"/>Nominalization<tag name="DOMAIN" value="end"/><tag name="FOCUS" value="end"/> In Natural Language .
The interpretation of <tag name="FOCUS" value="start"/><tag name="DOMAIN" value="start"/>nominalized expressions<tag name="DOMAIN" value="end"/><tag name="FOCUS" value="end"/> in English poses several problems .
First , it must be explained how their meanings are derived from the meanings of the underlying verbs .
Second , different forms of <tag name="DOMAIN" value="start"/><tag name="FOCUS" value="start"/>nominalizations<tag name="FOCUS" value="end"/><tag name="DOMAIN" value="end"/> differ in their semantic behavior .
Finally , aspectual restrictions which exist for ingofnominals must be explained .
The solution to be proposed is based on the assumption that <tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="start"/>non-stative verbs<tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="end"/> denote changes .
Changes can be conceived of in two different ways , either as objects which bring about a particular result or as relations between states .
A <tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="start"/>dynamic structure of events , intervals and states<tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="end"/> is defined in which both perspectives can be expressed by means of sorting the universe D. The basic idea is to augment a transition system for <tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="start"/>Dynamic Logic<tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="end"/> -LRB- <tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="start"/>DL<tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="end"/> -RRB- by a further domain of events such that programs from DL can be described either as objects or relations between states .
The interpretation of verbs is based on the second perspective : they denote -LRB- generalized -RRB- relations between states .
The interpretation of <tag name="DOMAIN" value="start"/><tag name="FOCUS" value="start"/>nominalized expressions<tag name="FOCUS" value="end"/><tag name="DOMAIN" value="end"/> uses the first perspective : they denote changes as objects .
Different forms of <tag name="DOMAIN" value="start"/><tag name="FOCUS" value="start"/>nominalizations<tag name="FOCUS" value="end"/><tag name="DOMAIN" value="end"/> denote different sorts of objects which are systematically related to the denotation of the underlying verb .
