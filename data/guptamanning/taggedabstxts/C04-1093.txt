<tag name="DOMAIN" value="start"/><tag name="FOCUS" value="start"/>Summarizing Encyclopedic Term Descriptions<tag name="FOCUS" value="end"/><tag name="DOMAIN" value="end"/> On The Web .
We are developing an automatic method to compile an <tag name="DOMAIN" value="start"/><tag name="FOCUS" value="start"/>encyclopedic corpus<tag name="FOCUS" value="end"/><tag name="DOMAIN" value="end"/> from the Web .
In our previous work , paragraph-style descriptions for a term are extracted from Web pages and organized based on domains .
However , these descriptions are independent and do not comprise a condensed text as in hand-crafted encyclopedias .
To resolve this problem , we propose a <tag name="FOCUS" value="start"/><tag name="DOMAIN" value="start"/>summarization<tag name="DOMAIN" value="end"/><tag name="FOCUS" value="end"/> method , which produces a single text from multiple descriptions .
The resultant summary concisely describes a term from different viewpoints .
We also show the eï¬€ectiveness of our method by means of experiments .
