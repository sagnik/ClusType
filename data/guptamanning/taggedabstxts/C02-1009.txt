A Robust Cross-Style <tag name="DOMAIN" value="start"/><tag name="FOCUS" value="start"/>Bilingual Sentences Alignment<tag name="FOCUS" value="end"/><tag name="DOMAIN" value="end"/> Model .
Most current <tag name="FOCUS" value="start"/><tag name="DOMAIN" value="start"/>sentence alignment<tag name="DOMAIN" value="end"/><tag name="FOCUS" value="end"/> approaches adopt sentence length and cognate as the alignment features ; and they are mostly trained and tested in the documents with the same style .
Since the length distribution , alignment-type distribution -LRB- used by length-based approaches -RRB- and cognate frequency vary significantly across texts with different styles , the length-based approaches fail to achieve similar performance when tested incorpora ofdifferent styles .
The experiments show that the performance in F-measure could drop from 98.2 % to 85.6 % when a length-based approach is trained by a technical manual and then tested on a general magazine .
Sincealargepercentageofcontentwordsinthesource text would be translated into the corresponding translation duals to preserve the meaning in the target text , <tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="start"/>transfer lexicons<tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="end"/> are usually regarded as more reliable cues for <tag name="DOMAIN" value="start"/><tag name="FOCUS" value="start"/>aligning sentences<tag name="FOCUS" value="end"/><tag name="DOMAIN" value="end"/> when the alignment task is performed by human .
To enhance the robustness , a robust <tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="start"/>statistical<tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="end"/> model based on both <tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="start"/>transfer lexicons<tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="end"/> and <tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="start"/>sentence lengths<tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="end"/> are proposed in this paper .
After integrating the <tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="start"/>transfer lexicons<tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="end"/> into the model , a 60 % F-measure error reduction -LRB- from 14.4 % to 5.8 % -RRB- is observed .
