Robustness is a key requirement in <tag name="DOMAIN" value="start"/><tag name="FOCUS" value="start"/>spoken language understanding<tag name="FOCUS" value="end"/><tag name="DOMAIN" value="end"/> -LRB- <tag name="DOMAIN" value="start"/><tag name="FOCUS" value="start"/>SLU<tag name="FOCUS" value="end"/><tag name="DOMAIN" value="end"/> -RRB- systems .
Human speech is often ungrammatical and ill-formed , and there will frequently be a mismatch between training and test data .
This paper discusses robustness and adaptation issues in a <tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="start"/>statistically-based<tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="end"/> <tag name="DOMAIN" value="start"/><tag name="FOCUS" value="start"/>SLU<tag name="FOCUS" value="end"/><tag name="DOMAIN" value="end"/> system which is entirely <tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="start"/>data-driven<tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="end"/> .
To test robustness , the system has been tested on data from the Air Travel Information Service -LRB- ATIS -RRB- domain which has been artificially corrupted with varying levels of additive noise .
Although the speech recognition performance degraded steadily , the system did not fail catastrophically .
Indeed , the rate at which the end-to-end performance of the complete system degraded was significantly slower than that of the actual recognition component .
In a second set of experiments , the ability to rapidly adapt the core understanding component of the system to a different application within the same broad domain has been tested .
Using only a small amount of training data , experiments have shown that a semantic parser based on the <tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="start"/>Hidden Vector State<tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="end"/> -LRB- <tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="start"/>HVS<tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="end"/> -RRB- model originally trained on the ATIS corpus can be straightforwardly adapted to the somewhat different DARPA Communicator task using standard <tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="start"/>adaptation<tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="end"/> algorithms .
The paper concludes by suggesting that the results presented provide initial support to the claim that an <tag name="DOMAIN" value="start"/><tag name="FOCUS" value="start"/>SLU<tag name="FOCUS" value="end"/> <tag name="DOMAIN" value="end"/>system which is <tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="start"/>statistically-based<tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="end"/> and trained entirely from data is intrinsically robust and can be readily adapted to new applications .
