The <tag name="FOCUS" value="start"/><tag name="DOMAIN" value="start"/>resolution of lexical ambiguity<tag name="DOMAIN" value="end"/><tag name="FOCUS" value="end"/> is important for most natural language processing tasks , and a range of computational techniques have been proposed for its solution .
None of these has yet proven effective on a large scale .
In this paper , we describe a method for <tag name="DOMAIN" value="start"/><tag name="FOCUS" value="start"/>lexical disambiguation of text<tag name="FOCUS" value="end"/><tag name="DOMAIN" value="end"/> using the definitions in a <tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="start"/>machine-readable dictionary<tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="end"/> together with the technique of <tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="start"/>simulated annealing<tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="end"/> .
The method operates on complete sentences and attempts to select the optimal combinations of word senses for all the words in the sentence simultaneously .
The words in the sentences may be any of the 28,000 headwords in Longman 's Dictionary of Contemporary English -LRB- LDOCE -RRB- and are disambiguated relative to the senses given in LDOCE .
Our initial results on a sample set of 50 sentences are comparable to those of other researchers , and the fully automatic method requires no hand coding of lexical entries , or hand tagging of text .
