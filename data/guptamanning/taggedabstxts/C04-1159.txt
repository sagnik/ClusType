This paper describes a project to detect <tag name="DOMAIN" value="start"/>dependencies <tag name="DOMAIN" value="end"/> between Japanese phrasal units called bunsetsus , and <tag name="DOMAIN" value="start"/>sentence boundaries in a spontaneous speech corpus<tag name="DOMAIN" value="end"/> .
In monologues , the biggest problem with dependency structure analysis is that sentence boundaries are ambiguous .
In this paper , we propose two methods for improving the accuracy of <tag name="FOCUS" value="start"/><tag name="DOMAIN" value="start"/>sentence boundary detection<tag name="DOMAIN" value="end"/><tag name="FOCUS" value="end"/> in <tag name="DOMAIN" value="start"/><tag name="FOCUS" value="start"/>spontaneous Japanese speech<tag name="FOCUS" value="end"/><tag name="DOMAIN" value="end"/> : One is based on <tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="start"/>statistical machine translation<tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="end"/> using <tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="start"/>dependency information<tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="end"/> and the other is based on <tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="start"/>text chunking using SVM<tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="end"/> .
An F-measure of 84.9 was achieved for the accuracy of sentence boundary detection by using the proposed methods .
The accuracy of dependency structure analysis was also improved from 75.2 % to 77.2 % by using automatically detected sentence boundaries .
The accuracy of dependency structure analysis and that of sentence boundary detection were also improved by interactively using both automatically detected dependency structures and sentence boundaries .
