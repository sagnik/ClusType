<tag name="FOCUS" value="start"/><tag name="DOMAIN" value="start"/>Speech-to-speech machine translation<tag name="DOMAIN" value="end"/><tag name="FOCUS" value="end"/> is in some ways the peak of natural language processing , in that it deals directly with our original , oral mode of communication -LRB- as opposed to derived written language -RRB- .
As such , it presents challenges that are not to be taken lightly .
Although existing technology covers each of the steps in the process , from speech recognition to synthesis , deriving a model of translation that is effective in the domain of spoken language is an interesting and challenging task .
If we could teach our algorithms to learn as children acquire language , the result would be useful both for language technology and cognitive science .
We propose several potential approaches , an implementation of a <tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="start"/>multi-path<tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="end"/> model that <tag name="DOMAIN" value="start"/><tag name="FOCUS" value="start"/>translates<tag name="FOCUS" value="end"/><tag name="DOMAIN" value="end"/> recognized morphemes alongside words,andaweb-interfacetotestourspeech translation tool as trained for Finnish to English .
We also discuss current approaches to <tag name="DOMAIN" value="start"/><tag name="FOCUS" value="start"/>machine translation<tag name="FOCUS" value="end"/><tag name="DOMAIN" value="end"/> and the problems they face in adapting simultaneously to morphologically rich languages and to the spoken modality .
