The Hyperonym Problem Revisited : <tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="start"/>Conceptual And Lexical Hierarchies<tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="end"/> In <tag name="FOCUS" value="start"/><tag name="DOMAIN" value="start"/>Language Generation<tag name="DOMAIN" value="end"/><tag name="FOCUS" value="end"/> .
When a lexical item is selected in the <tag name="DOMAIN" value="start"/><tag name="FOCUS" value="start"/>language production<tag name="FOCUS" value="end"/><tag name="DOMAIN" value="end"/> process , it needs to be explained why none of its superordinates gets selected instead , since their applicability conditions are fulfilled all the same .
This question has received much attention in cognitive modelling and not as much in other branches of NLG .
This paper describes the various approaches taken , discusses the reasons why they are so different , and argues that <tag name="DOMAIN" value="start"/><tag name="FOCUS" value="start"/>production<tag name="FOCUS" value="end"/><tag name="DOMAIN" value="end"/> models using  <tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="start"/>symbolic representations<tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="end"/> should make a distinction between <tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="start"/>conceptual and lexical hierarchies<tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="end"/> , which can be organized along fixed levels as studied in -LRB- some branches of -RRB- lexical semantics .
