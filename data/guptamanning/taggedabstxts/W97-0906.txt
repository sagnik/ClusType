The paper describes the experiences of a multi-national consortium in an on-going project to construct a <tag name="FOCUS" value="start"/><tag name="DOMAIN" value="start"/>multilingual authoring<tag name="DOMAIN" value="end"/><tag name="FOCUS" value="end"/> tool for business letters .
The consortium consists of two universities -LRB- both with significant experience in language engineering -RRB- , three software companies , and various potential commercial users with the organizations being located in a total of four countries .
The paper covers the history of the development of the project from an academic idea but focuses on the implications of the user-requirements orientated outlook of the commercial developers and the implications of this view for the system architecture , user requirements , delivery platforms and so on .
Particularly interesting consequences of the user requirements are the <tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="start"/>database centred architecture<tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="end"/> , and the constraints and opportunities this presents for development of <tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="start"/>grammatical components<tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="end"/> at both the text and sentence level .
