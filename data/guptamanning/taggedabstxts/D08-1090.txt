Traditionally , statistical machine translation systems have relied on parallel bi-lingual data to train a translation model .
While bi-lingual parallel data are expensive to generate , monolingual data are relatively common .
Yet monolingual data have been under-utilized , having been used primarily for training a language model in the target language .
This paper describes a novel method for utilizing monolingual target data to improve the performance of a <tag name="FOCUS" value="start"/><tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="start"/>statistical<tag name="TECHNIQUE" value="end"/> <tag name="DOMAIN" value="start"/>machine translation system<tag name="DOMAIN" value="end"/><tag name="FOCUS" value="end"/> on news stories .
The method exploits the existence of comparable text -- multiple texts in the target language that discuss the same or similar stories as found in the source language document .
For every source document that is to be translated , a large monolingual data set in the target language is searched for documents that might be comparable to the source documents .
These documents are then used to adapt the <tag name="DOMAIN" value="start"/><tag name="FOCUS" value="start"/>MT<tag name="FOCUS" value="end"/><tag name="DOMAIN" value="end"/> system to increase the probability of generating texts that resemble the comparable document .
Experimental results obtained by adapting both the <tag name="DOMAIN" value="start"/><tag name="FOCUS" value="start"/>language and translation<tag name="FOCUS" value="end"/><tag name="DOMAIN" value="end"/> models show substantial gains over the baseline system .
